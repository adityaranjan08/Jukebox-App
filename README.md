**Getting Started:**

This repository holds the source code for the Jukebox App. If you're a developer interested in contributing to the project, here's how to get involved:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityaranjan08/Jukebox-App.git
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment:**

   - Install required dependencies (likely mentioned in a requirements file or instructions within the code).
   * The specific technologies used will depend on whether the app is for Android or iOS:
      * **Android:** You might need tools like Android Studio, along with dependencies like Java or Kotlin for development.
      * **iOS:** Xcode would be the primary development tool, and Swift would be the programming language.

3. **Explore the codebase:** The codebase structure will likely consist of separate folders for the frontend (user interface), backend (server-side logic interacting with music libraries or APIs), and potentially functionalities for offline playback or recommendation algorithms (depending on the app's features).

4. **Contribute!** 
   - If you find bugs, feel free to submit bug reports.
